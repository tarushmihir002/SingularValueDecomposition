#Singular Value Decomposition of some book titles we are having in our dataset using TruncatedSVD. This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of truncated singular value decomposition (SVD).
#Contrary to PCA, this estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value decomposition. This means it can work with sparse matrices efficiently. When we perform SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) on text data it is also called LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis).
