# NLP Project using Transformer.

Singular Value Decomposition of some book titles in our dataset using TruncatedSVD. This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction using truncated singular value decomposition (SVD).

Contrary to PCA, this estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value decomposition. This means it can work with sparse matrices efficiently. When we perform SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) on text data it is also called LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis).
